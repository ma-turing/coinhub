## üöÄ Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before installing CoinHub, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher)
  - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Verify installation: `node --version`
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
  - Verify npm: `npm --version`
  - Or install yarn: `npm install -g yarn`
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
  - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd coinhub
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Choose one of the following package managers:

#### Using npm (recommended):
```bash
npm install
```

#### Using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

This will install all the required dependencies including:

- **React 18.2.0** - Core React library
- **React Router DOM 6.22.1** - Client-side routing
- **Redux Toolkit 2.2.1** - State management
- **React Redux 9.1.0** - React bindings for Redux
- **Apollo Client 3.8.10** - GraphQL client
- **Styled Components 6.1.8** - CSS-in-JS styling
- **Axios 1.6.8** - HTTP client for API requests
- **GraphQL 16.8.1** - Query language for APIs

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

#### Using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

#### Using yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open in your default browser.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Once the development server is running, you should see the CoinHub application in your browser. The app should load without any console errors.

## üìã Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.2.0
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + React Redux
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Styling**: Styled Components
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **GraphQL Client**: Apollo Client
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (React Scripts)

## üîß Development Setup

### Environment Variables
If the application requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Example environment variables (adjust as needed)
REACT_APP_API_URL=your_api_url_here
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=your_graphql_endpoint_here
```

### Code Style and Linting
The project uses ESLint with React app configuration. The linting rules are defined in the `eslintConfig` section of `package.json`.

## üì± Browser Support

The application supports:

**Production:**
- Browsers with >0.2% market share
- Not dead browsers
- Not Opera Mini

**Development:**
- Latest Chrome version
- Latest Firefox version
- Latest Safari version

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Node.js version compatibility**: Ensure you're using Node.js 16.0 or higher
2. **Port 3000 already in use**: The app will prompt to use a different port
3. **npm/yarn cache issues**: Try clearing cache with `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean`
4. **Module not found errors**: Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock`, then reinstall dependencies

### Getting Help:
If you encounter issues during installation, please check:
- Node.js and npm versions are compatible
- All dependencies installed successfully
- No firewall blocking localhost:3000
- Console for any error messages
